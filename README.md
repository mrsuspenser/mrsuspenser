- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrsuspenser
- 👀 I’m interested in information technology, networking, security, integrity, gaming, and working hard in order to relax.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Network+ and Security+.  Looking to learn Python in the near future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, however, once my feet are wet I am open to the idea.
- 📫 How to reach me, don't.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm 6'4"
